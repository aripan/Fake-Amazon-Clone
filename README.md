## React-Amazon-Clone

A full-stack Amazon Clone application is built using React and Firebase(Backend-as-a-Service).

## Functionality

Well if you are familiar with the interface of Amazon, then you already know what you are going to experience. If not, then following functionalities are expected to experience:

1. Shows Home page where you can access the following:

- Display Products
- Sign In functionality
- Return & Order Page
- Checkout Page

2. While surfing, the user can make a decision by choosing a product from the display depending on the price & review.

3. The user can checkout the product in the basket as well as remove it from the basket.

4. Along with 1, 2, and 3, the user can go on to buy the product. For that the user must be logged-in.

5. A new user can register his/her account as well.

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node JS
- Backend-as-a-Service: Firebase

## Hosted Version

The latest version is deployed and hosted on Firebase. Check it out by clicking [HERE](https://react--clone-c8de9.web.app).

## Usage

You can login using the following credentials:

- Email: test@gmail.com
- Password: password

Or you can Register using a fake email/password.

## Notes

1. The Web App uses SSL encryption through HTTPS protocol to transfer input data.

2. Passwords are hashed once received by the backend.

3. Despite 1 and 2, I'd still recommend using a fake/weak password to avoid any potential future attacks.

4. Emails aren't verified, so you can use any email even if it's fake.

## Last but not least

- Sometimes the server responds slow for login/register requests, so please be patient.

- However, do check your browser console for any potential bad requests or errors.

- Raise an issue in case you find any.
